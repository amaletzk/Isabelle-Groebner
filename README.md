This repository contains the Isabelle/HOL source files of the formalization of various advanced concepts in the theory of Groebner bases, including

- reduced Groebner bases,
- basics of Macaulay matrices,
- Faugere's F4 algorithm,
- a method for computing Groebner bases through Macaulay matrices,
- degree-bounds of Groebner bases.

The contents of this repository work with the development version of Isabelle. Sooner or later, all the theories are planned to be submitted to the
Archive of Formal Proofs.
